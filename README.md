mpbOrm
======

This is a small experimental ORM I'm creating. The goal is to have excellent support for Mono and PostgreSQL, because it feels like Linux support is pretty much just an afterthought in every other ORM in the .Net world.

The ORM is built upon Dapper, and has built in CRUD operations, an object cache, transaction management and some simple querying.

*STATUS:* Almost functional
